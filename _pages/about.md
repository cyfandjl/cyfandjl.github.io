Current interest/research
------
I'm a Ph.D student in my third year at Electrical and Computer department of Michigan State University. My reserach is focusing on Theoretical Studies on Ultrafast and Nanoscale Electron Emission and Transport. Currently, we are studying the effect of frequency spectra of different profiles laser field on photoemission. Electron sources are critical to many applications such as X-ray generation, electron microscopy, accerlarator and nanoscale vacuum devices. We have studied direct density modulation of electron beam from the emission, which is applicable on many vacuum devices, such as traveling wave tubes.
