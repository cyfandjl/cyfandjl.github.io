Current interest/research
------
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Michigan State University. My research focuses on **Theoretical Studies of Ultrafast and Nanoscale Electron Emission and Transport**, with an emphasis on understanding the effects of laser field frequency spectra on photoemission. This work is essential for advancing electron sources, which are critical for applications such as X-ray generation, electron microscopy, accelerators, and nanoscale vacuum devices.

Currently, We are investigating how the different laser field profiles influence electron emission dynamics. Additionally, we have explored direct density modulation of electron beams during emission, which has significant applications in various vacuum devices, including traveling wave tubes. Our research contributes to the development of more efficient and precise electron sources for advanced technological systems.
